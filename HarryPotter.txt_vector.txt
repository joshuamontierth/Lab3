Very

Griphook
Stand

Hagrid
Best

Harry
Harry
I
still
need
a
wand
Hagrid
A
wand
Well
youll
want
Ollivanders
No
place
better
Run
along
there
but
wait
I
just
got
one
more
thing
I
got
to
do
Wont
be
long
Harry
Hello
Hello
Ollivander
I
wondered
when
Id
be
seeing
you
Mr
Potter
It
seems
only
yesterday
that
your
mother
and
father
were
in
here
buying
their
first
wands
Ah
Here
we
are
Well
give
it
a
wave
Apparently
not
Perhaps
this
No
no
definitely
not
No
matter
I
wonder
Curious
very
curious
Harry
Sorry
but
whats
curious
Ollivander
I
remember
every
wand
Ive
ever
sold
Mr
Potter
It
just
so
happens
that
the
phoenix
whose
tail
feather
resides
in
your
wand
gave
one
other
feather
just
one
It
is
curious
that
you
should
be
destined
for
this
wand
when
its
brother
gave
you
that
scar
Harry
And
who
owned
that
wand
Ollivander
Oh
we
do
not
speak
his
name
The
wand
chooses
the
wizard
Mr
Potter
Its
not
always
clear
why
but
I
think
it
is
clear
that
we
can
expect
great
things
from
you
After
all
He
Who
Must
Not
Be
Named
did
great
things
terrible
yes
but
great
Hagrid
Harry
Harry
Happy
birthday
Harry
Wow
The
Boy
Who
Lived
Hagrid
You
all
right
Harry
You
seem
very
quiet
Harry
He
killed
my
parents
didnt
he
The
one
who
gave
me
this
You
know
Hagrid
I
know
you
do
Hagrid
First
and
understand
this
Harry
cause
its
very
important
Not
all
wizards
are
good
Some
of
them
go
bad
A
few
years
ago
there
was
one
wizard
who
went
as
bad
as
you
can
go
And
his
name
was
V
his
name
was
V
Harry
Maybe
if
you
wrote
it
down
Hagrid
No
I
cant
spell
it
All
right
Voldemort
Harry
Voldemort
Hagrid
Shh
Hagrid
It
was
dark
times
Harry
dark
times
Voldemort
started
to
gather
some
followers
brought
em
over
to
the
dark
side
Anyone
that
stood
up
to
him
ended
up
dead
Your
parents
fought
against
him
but
nobody
lived
once
he
decided
to
kill
em
Nobody
not
one
Cept
you
Harry
Me
Voldemort
tried
to
kill
me
Hagrid
Yes
That
aint
no
ordinary
cut
on
your
forehead
Harry
A
mark
like
that
only
comes
from
being
touched
by
a
curse
and
an
evil
curse
at
that
Harry
What
happened
to
to
You
Know
Who
Hagrid

denied
Ron
I

you
Youre
Nearly
Headless
Nick
Nick
I

Hermione
Nearly

How

Nick
Like

Ron
Ahh
Percy
Gryffindors

please
Keep

Thank

Boy
Ravenclaws

This
way
Percy
This
is
the
most
direct
path
to
the
dormitories
Oh

keep
an
eye
on
the
staircases
they
like
to
change
Percy
Keep

Quickly

Percy
Caput
Draconis
Follow
me
everyone
Keep
up
quickly
come
on
Girl
Oh

Percy
Gather
round
here
Welcome
to
the
Gryffindor
Common
Room
Boys
dormitories
upstairs
and
down
to
your
left
Girls
the
same
on
your
right
Youll
find
that
your
belongings
have
already
been
brought
up
Potions
and
Parcels
Ron
Whew
we
made
it
Can
you
imagine
the
look
on
McGonagalls
face
if
we
were
late
Ron
That
was
bloody
brilliant
McGonagall
Thank
you
for
that
assessment
Mr
Weasley
Perhaps
if
I
were
to
transfigure
Mr
Potter
and
yourself
into
a
pocketwatch
that
way
one
of
you
might
be
on
time
Harry
We
got
lost
McGonagall
Then
perhaps
a
map
I
trust
you
dont
need
one
to
find
your
seats
Snape
There
will
be
no
foolish
wand
waving
or
silly
incantations
in
this
class
As
such
I
dont
expect
many
of
you
to
appreciate
the
subtle
science
and
exact
art
that
is
potion
making
However
for
those
select
few
who
possess
the
predisposition
I
can
teach
you
how
to
bewitch
the
mind
and
ensnare
the
senses
I
can
tell
you
how
to
bottle
fame
brew
glory
and
even
put
a
stopper
in
death
Then
again
maybe
some
of
you
have
come
to
Hogwarts
in
possession
of
abilities
so
formidable
that
you
feel
confidant
enough
to
not
pay
attention
Mr
Potter
Our
new
celebrity
Tell
me
what
would
I
get
if
I
added
powdered
root
of
asphodel
to
an
infusion
of
wormwood
You
dont
know
Well
lets
try
again
Where
Mr
Potter
would
you
look
if
I
asked
you
to
find
me
a
bezoar
Harry
I
dont
know
sir
Snape
And
what
is
the
difference
between
monkshood
and
wolfbane
Harry
I
dont
know
sir
Snape
Pity
Clearly
fame
isnt
everything
is
it
Mr
Potter
Harry
Clearly
Hermione
knows
Since
its
a
pity
not
to
ask
her
Snape
Silence
And
put
her
hand
down
you
silly
girl
For
your
information
Potter
asphodel
and
wormwood
make
a
sleeping
potion
so
powerful
it
is
known
as
the
Draught
of
Living
Death
A
bezoar
is
a
stone
taken
from
the
stomach
of
a
goat
and
it
will
save
you
from
most
poisons
As
for
monkshood
and
wolfsbane
they
are
the
same
plant
which
also
goes
by
the
name
of
aconite
Well
Why
arent
you
all
copying
this
down
And
Gryffindors
note
that
five
points
will
be
taken
from
your
house
for
your
classmates

Harry

Didnt

Ron
I

Or

Ron
She

her
priorities
Facts

Feathers
Oliver
Quidditch

seeker
Thats

There
are
three
kinds
of
balls
This

the
Quaffle

chasers
handle
the
Quaffle

three
hoops
The
keeper

Oliver
Bludger
Nasty

buggers
But
you

Golden
Snitch
Harry
I
like
this
ball
Oliver
Ah

it
now
Just
wait
Its
wicked
fast
and

Oliver
You

Harry
How
could
a
troll
get
in
Ron
Not
by
itself
Trolls

really
stupid
Probably
people
playing
jokes
What
Harry
Hermione
She

both
of
you
Ron

Harry
Well

it
is
Hermione
Its
my
fault
Professor
McGonagall
McGonagall
Miss
Granger
Hermione
I
went
looking
for
the
troll
Id
read
about
them
and
thought
I
could
handle
it
But
I
was
wrong
If
Harry
and
Ron
hadnt
come
and
found
me
Id
probably
be
dead
McGonagall
Be
that
as
it
may
be
it
was
an
extremely
foolish
thing
to
do
I
would
have
expected
more
rational
behavior
on
your
part
Miss
Granger
Five
points
will
be
taken
from
Gryffindor
for
your
serious
lack
of
judgment
As
for
you
two
gentlemen
I
just
hope
you
realize
how
fortunate
you
are
Not
many
students
could
take
on
a
fully
grown
mountain
troll
and
live
to
tell
the
tale
Five
points
will
be
awarded
to
each
of
you
For
sheer
dumb
luck
Quirrell
Perhaps
you
ought
to
go
M
might
wake
up
heh
Ahh
Hehe

Harry
Good
for
you
to
get
us
out
of
trouble
like
that
Ron
Mind
you
I
mean
we
did
save
her
life
Harry
Mind
you
she
didnt
need
saving
if
you
hadnt
insulted
her
Ron
What
are
friends
for
Quidditch
Ron
Take
a
bit
of
toast
mate
go
on
Hermione
Rons
right
Harry
Youre
gonna
need
your
strength
today
Harry
Im
not
hungry
Snape
Good
luck
today
Potter
Then
again
now
that
youve
proven
yourself
against
a
troll
a
little
game
of
Quidditch
should
be
easy
work
for
you
even
if
it
is
against
Slytherin
Harry
That
explains
the
blood
Hermione
Blood
Harry
Listen
last
night
Im
guessing
Snape
let
the
troll
in
as
a
diversion
so
he
could
try
and
get
past
that

headed
dog
But
he
got
himself
bitten
thats
why
hes
limping
Hermione
But
why
would
anyone
go
near
that
dog
Harry
The
day
I
was
at
Gringotts
Hagrid
took
something
out
of
one
of
the
vaults
He
said
it
was
Hogwarts
business
very
secret
Hermione
So
youre
saying
Harry
Thats
what
the
dogs
guarding
Thats
what
Snape
wants
Hermione
Bit
early
for
mail
isnt
it
Harry
But
I
I
never
get
mail
Ron

Quirrell

You

Well

chat
soon
when
youve
had
time
to
decide
where
your
loyalties
lie
Filch
Oh
Professors
I
found
this
in
the
Restricted
Section
Its
still
hot
That
means
theres
a
student
out
of
bed
The
Mirror
of
Erised
Harry
Mum
Dad
Harry
Ron
Youve
really
got
to
see
this
Ron
Youve
got
to
see
this
Ron
Ron
come
on
Get
out
of
bed
Ron
Why
Harry
Theres
something
youve
got
to
see
Now
come
on
Harry
Come
on
Come
Come
look
its
my
parents
Ron
I
only
see
me
Harry
Look
in
properly
Go
on
Stand
there
There
You
see
them
dont
you
Thats
my
dad
Ron
Thats
me
Only
Im
head
boy
and
Im
holding
the
Quidditch
cup
And
bloody
hell
Im
Quidditch
Captain
too
I
look

Harry
do
you
think
this
mirror
shows
the
future
Harry
How
can
it
Both
my
parents
are
dead
George
Do
you
like
yours
Ron
Ron
Ron
Ill

Harry
No
Ron
We
go
and
visit
Hagrid
Harry
No
Ron
Harry
I
know
what
youre
thinking
but
dont
Theres
something
not
quite
right
about
that
mirror
Dumbledore
Back
again
Harry
I
see
that
you
like
so
many
before
you
have
discovered
the
delights
of
the
Mirror
of
Erised
I
trust
by
now
you
realize
what
it
does
Let
me
give
you
a
clue
The
happiest
man
on
earth
would
look
into
the
mirror
and
see
only
himself
exactly
as
he
is
Harry
So
then
it
shows
us
what
we
want
Whatever
we
want
Dumbledore
Yes
and
no
It
shows
us
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
deepest
most
desperate
desires
of
our
hearts
Now
you
who
have
never
known
your
family
you
see
them
standing
beside
you
But
remember
this
Harry
This
mirror
gives
us
neither
knowledge
or
truth
Men
have
wasted
away
in
front
of
it
even
gone
mad
That
is
why
tomorrow
it
will
be
moved
to
a
new
home
and
I
must
ask
you
not
to
go
looking
for
it
again
It
does
not
do
to
dwell
on
dreams
Harry
and
forget
to
live
Norbert
Harry
Hi
Hedwig
Hermione
Look
at
you
playing
with
your
cards
Pathetic
Weve
got
final
exams
coming
up
soon
Ron
Im
ready
Ask
me
any
question
Hermione
All
right
what
are
the
three
most
crucial
ingredients
in
a
Forgetfulness
Potion
Ron
I
forgot
Hermione
And
what
may
I
ask
do
you
plan
to
do
if
this
comes
up
in
the
final
exam
Ron
Copy
off
you
Hermione
No
you
wont
Besides
according
to
Professor
McGonagall
were
to
be
given
special
quills
bewitched
with
an
anti
cheating
spell
Ron
Thats
insulting
Its
as
if
they
dont
trust
us
Dumbledore
again
Ron
Leg
Locker
Curse
Harry
Malfoy
Ron
You
have
got
to
start
standing
up
to
people
Neville
Neville
How
I
can
barely
stand
at
all
Seamus
Ill
do
the
counter
curse
Neville
No
thats
all
I
need
you
to
set
my
bloody
kneecaps
on
fire
Seamus
I
dont
appreciate
the
insinuation
Longbottom
Besides
if
anyone
cares
to
notice
my
eyebrows
have
completely
grown
back
Harry
I
found
him
Ron
Dumbledore
is
particularly
famous
for
his
defeat
of
the
Dark
Wizard
Grindelwald
in

Harry
Go
on
Ron

for
his
discovery
of
the

uses
of
Dragon
Blood
and
his
work
on
alchemy
with
his
partner
Nicolas
Flamel
Harry
I
knew
the
name
sounded
familiar
I
read
it
on
the
train
that
day
Hermione
Follow
me
Neville
Hey
wait
where
are
you
going
What
about
the
counter
curse
Hermione
I
had
you
looking
in
the
wrong
section
How
could
I
be
so
stupid
I
checked
this
out
a
few
weeks
ago
for
a
bit
of
light
reading
Ron
This
is
light
Hermione
Of
course
Here
it
is
Nicholas
Flamel
is
the
only
known
maker
of
the
Philosophers
Stone
Ron
and
Harry
The
what
Hermione
Honestly
dont
you
two
read
The
Philosophers
Stone
is
a
legendary
substance
with
astonishing
powers
It
will
turn
any
metal
into
pure
gold
and
produces
the
Elixir
of
Life
which
will
make
the
drinker
immortal
Ron
Immortal
Hermione
It
means
youll
never
die
Ron
I
know
what
it
means
Harry
Shh
Hermione
The
only
stone
currently
in
existence
belongs
to
Mr
Nicholas
Flamel
the
noted
alchemist
who
last
year
celebrated
his
th
birthday
Thats
what
Fluffys
guarding
on
the
rd
floor
Thats
whats
under
the
trapdoor
the
Philosophers
Stone
Harry
Hagrid
Hagrid
Oh
hello
Sorry
dont
wish
to
be
rude
but
Im
in
no
fit
state
to
entertain
today
All
three
We
know
about
the
Philosophers
Stone
Hagrid
Oh
Harry
We
think
Snapes
trying
to
steal
it
Hagrid
Snape
Blimey
Harry
youre
not
still
on
about
him
are
you
Harry
Hagrid
we
know
hes
after
the
Stone
We
just
dont
know
why
Hagrid
Snape
is
one
of
the
teachers
protecting
the
Stone
Hes
not
about
to
steal
it
Harry
What
Hagrid
You
heard
Right
Come
on
now
Im
a
bit
preoccupied
today
Harry
Wait
a
minute
One
of
the
teachers
Hermione
Of
course
There
are
other
things
defending
the
Stone
arent
there
Spells
enchantments
Hagrid
Thats
right
Waste
of
bloody
time
if
you
ask
me
Aint
no
one
gonna
get
past
Fluffy
Hehe
not
a
soul
knows
how
Except
for
me
and
Dumbledore
I
shouldnt
have
told
you
that
I
shouldnt
have
told
you
that
Oh

Hagrid

won
it
Off
a
stranger
I
met
down
at
a
pub
Seemed
quite
glad
to
be
rid
off
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
Hermione
Is
that
a
dragon
Ron
Thats
not
just
a
dragon
Thats
a
Norwegian
Ridgeback
My
brother

Malfoy

Harry
I
dont
understand
Is

Ron
Its

McGonagall
Good
evening
McGonagall
Nothing
I
repeat
nothing
gives
a
student
the
right
to
walk
about
the
school
at
night
Therefore
as
punishment
for
your
actions

points
will
be
taken
Harry

McGonagall
Each
And
to
ensure
it
doesnt
happen
again
all
four
of
you
will
receive
detention
Draco
Excuse
me
Professor
Perhaps
I
heard
you
wrong
I
thought
you
said
the
four
of
us
McGonagall
No
you
heard
me
correctly
Mr
Malfoy
You
see
as
honorable
as
your
intentions
were
you
too
were
out
of
bed
after
hours
You
will
serve
detention
with
your
classmates
The
Forbidden
Forest
Filch
A
pity
they
let
the
old
punishments
die
There
was
a
time
detention
would
find
you
hanging
by
your
thumbs
in
the
dungeons
God
I
miss
the
screaming
Youll
be
serving
detention
with
Hagrid
tonight
Hes

dark
forest
A

Filch
Oh

Youre
going
into
the
forest
after

Got
to
have
your
wits
about
you
Draco
The
forest
I
thought
that

a
joke
We
cant
go
in
there
Students
arent
allowed
And
there
are
werewolves
Filch
Theres
more
than
werewolves

those
trees
lad
You

be
sure
of
that
Nighty
night
Hagrid
Right
Lets

Harry
Hagrid
whats
that
Hagrid
What
were
here
for
See
that
Thats
unicorns
blood
that
is
I
found
one
dead
a
few
weeks
ago
Now
this
ones
been
injured
bad
by
something
So
its
our
job
to
find
the
poor
beast
Ron
Hermione
youll
come
with
me
Ron
Okay
Hagrid
And
Harry
youll
go
with
Malfoy
Draco
Okay
Then
I
get
Fang
Hagrid
Fine
Just
so
you

hes
a
bloody
coward
Draco
You
wait
till
my
father
hears
about

This
is
servants
stuff
Harry
If
I
didnt

Draco
Id

scared
Draco
Scared
Potter
Did
you
hear
that
Come
on
Fang
Scared
Harry
What
is
it
Fang
Draco
HELP
Firenze
Harry
Potter
you
must
leave
You
are
known
to
many
creatures
here
The
forest
is
not
safe
at
this
time
Especially
for
you
Harry
But
what
was
that
thing
you
saved
me
from
Firenze
A
monstrous
creature
It
is
a
terrible
crime
to
slay
a
unicorn
Drinking
the
blood
of
a
unicorn
will
keep
you
alive
even
if
you
are
an
inch
from
death
But
at
a
terrible
price
You
have
slain
something
so
pure
that
the
moment
the
blood
touches
your
lips
you
will
have
a
half
life
A
cursed
life
Harry
But
who
would
choose
such
a
life
Firenze
Can
you
think
of
no
one
Harry
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
thing
that
killed
the
unicorn
that
was
drinking
its
blood
that
was
Voldemort
Firenze
Do
you
know
what
is
hidden
in
the
school
at
this
very
moment
Harry
The
Philosophers
Stone
Hermione
Harry
Hagrid
Hello
there
Firenze
I
see
youve
met
our
young
Mr
Potter
You
all
right
there
Harry
Firenze
Harry
Potter
this
is
where
I
leave
you
Youre
safe
now
Good
luck
Up
to
Something
Hermione
You
mean
You
Know
Whos
out
there
right
now
in
the
forest
Harry
But
hes
weak
Hes
living
off
the
unicorns
Dont
you
see
We
had
it
wrong
Snape
doesnt
want
the
Stone
for
himself
he
wants
the
Stone
for
Voldemort
With
the
Elixir
of
Life
Voldemort
will
be
strong
again
Hell
hell
come
back
Ron
But
if
he
comes
back
you
dont
think
hell
try
to
kill
you
do
you
Harry
I
think
if
hed
had
the
chance
he
mightve
tried
to
kill
me
tonight
Ron
And
to
think
Ive
been
worrying
about
my
Potions
final
Hermione
Hang
on
a
minute
Were
forgetting
one
thing
Whos
the
one
wizard
Voldemort
always
feared
Dumbledore
As
long
as
Dumbledores
around
Harry
youre
safe
As
long
as
Dumbledores
around
you
cant
be
touched
Harry
You
No
I
it
cant
be
Snape
h
he
was
the
one
Quirrell
Yes
He
does
seem
the
type
doesnt
he
Next
to
him
who
would
suspect
p
p
p
poor
st
stuttering
Professor
Quirrell
Harry
But
but
that
day
during
the
Quidditch
match
Snape
tried
to
kill
me
Quirrell
No
dear
boy
I
tried
to
kill
you
And
trust
me
if
Snapes
cloak
hadnt
caught
fire
and
broken
my
eye
contact
I
would
have
succeeded
even
with
Snape
muttering
his
little
countercurse
Harry
Snape
was
trying
to
save
me
Quirrell
I
knew
you
were
a
danger
to
me
right
from
the
off
Especially
after
Halloween
Harry
Then
then
you
let
the
troll
in
Quirrell
Very
good
Potter
yes
Snape
unfortunately
wasnt
fooled
While
everyone
else
was
running
about
the
dungeon
he
went
to
the
third
floor
to
head
me
off
He
of
course
never
trusted
me
again
He
rarely
left
me
alone
But
he
doesnt
understand
Im
never
alone
never
Now
what
does
this
mirror
do
I
see
what
I
desire
I
see
myself
holding
the
stone
But
how
do
I
get
it
Unseen
Inhuman
Voice
Use
the
boy
Quirrell
Come
here
Potter
Now
Tell
me
what
do
you
see
What
is
it
What
do
you
see
Harry
I
Im
shaking
hands
with
Dumbledore
Ive
won
the
House
Cup
Unseen
Inhuman
Voice
He
lies
Quirrell
Tell
the
truth
What
do
you
see
Unseen
Inhuman
Voice
Let
me
speak
to
him
Quirrell
Master
you
are
not
strong
enough
Unseen
Inhuman
Voice
I
have
strength
enough
for
this
Voldemort
Harry
Potter
we
meet
again
Harry
Voldemort
Voldemort
Yes
You
see
what
Ive
become
See
what
I
must
do
to
survive
Live
off
another
a
mere
parasite
Unicorn
blood
can
sustain
me
but
it
cannot
give
me
a
body
of
my
own
But
there
is
something
that
can
something
that
conveniently
enough
lies
in
your
pocket
Magic
Touch
Voldemort
Stop
him
Dont
be
a
fool
Why
suffer
a
horrific
death
when
you
can
join
me
and
live
Harry
Never
Voldemort
Haha
Bravery
Your
parents
had
it
too
Tell
me
Harry
would
you
like
to
see
your
mother
and
father
again
Together
we
can
bring
them
back
All
I
ask
for
is
something
in
return
Thats
it
Harry
There
is
no
good
and
evil
There
is
only
power
and
those
too
weak
to
seek
it
Together
well
do
extraordinary
things
Just
give
me
the
stone
Harry
You
liar
Voldemort
Kill
him
Quirrell
Ahh
Ahh
What
is
this
magic
Voldemort
Fool
Get
the
stone
Mark
of
Love
Dumbledore
Good
afternoon
Harry
Ah
Tokens
from
your
admirers
Harry
Admirers
Dumbledore
What
happened
down
in
the
dungeons
between
you
and
Professor
Quirrell
is
a
complete
secret
so
naturally
the
whole
school
knows
Ah
I
see
your
friend
Ronald
has
saved
you
the
trouble
of
opening
your
Chocolate
Frogs
Harry
Ron
was
here
Is
he
all
right
What
about
Hermione
Dumbledore
Fine
Theyre
both
just
fine
Harry
But
what
happened
to
the
Stone
Dumbledore
Relax
dear
boy
The
stone
has
been
destroyed
My
friend
Nicholas
and
I
had
a
little
chat
and
agreed
it
was
best
all
around
Harry
But
Flamel
hell
die
wont
he
Dumbledore
He
has
enough
Elixir
to
set
his
affairs
in
order
But
yes
he
will
die
Harry
How
is
it
I
got
the
Stone
sir
One
minute
I
was
staring
in
the
mirror
and
the
next
Dumbledore
Ah
You
see
only
a
person
who
wanted
to
find
the
Stone
find
it
but
not
use
it
would
be
able
to
get
it
That
is
one
of
my
more
brilliant
ideas
And
between
you
and
me
thats
saying
something
Harry
Does
that
mean
with
the
Stone
gone
I
mean
that
Voldemort
can
never
come
back
Dumbledore
Ah
Im
afraid
there
are
ways
in
which
he
can
return
Harry
do
you
know
why
Professor
Quirrell
couldnt
bear
to
have
you
touch
him
It
was
because
of
your
mother
She
sacrificed
herself
for
you
and
that
kind
of
act
leaves
a
mark
No
no
this
kind
of
mark
cannot
be
seen
It
lives
in
your
very
skin
Harry
What
is
it
Dumbledore
Love
Harry
love
Ah
Bertie
Botts
Every
Flavor
Beans
I
was
most
unfortunate
in
my
youth
to
come
across
a
vomit
flavored
one
and
since
then
I
have
lost
my
liking
for
them
But
I
think
I
could
be
safe
with
a
nice
toffee
Mm
Alas
Earwax
Harry
All
right
there
Ron
Ron
All
right
You
Harry
All
right
Hermione
Hermione
Never
better
House
Cup
Winner
Dumbledore
Another
year
gone
And
now
as
I
understand
it
the
house
cup
needs
awarded
and
the
points
stand
thus
In
fourth
place
Gryffindor
with

points
In
third
place
Hufflepuff
with

points
Second
Ravenclaw
with

points
And
in
first
place
with

points
Slytherin
house
Yes
well
done
Slytherin
well
done
Slytherin
However
recent
events
must
be
taken
into
account
and
I
have
a
few
last
minute
points
to
award
First
to
Miss
Hermione
Granger
for
the
cool
use
of
intellect
while
others
were
in
grave
peril
fifty
points
Second
to
Mr
Ronald
Weasley
for
the
best
played
game
of
chess
that
Hogwarts
has
seen
these
many
years
fifty
points
And
third
to
mister
Harry
Potter
for
pure
love
and
outstanding
courage
I
award
Gryffindor
house
sixty
points
Hermione
Were
tied
with
Slytherin
Dumbledore
And
finally
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
bravery
to
stand
up
to
your
enemies
but
a
great
deal
more
to
stand
up
to
your
friends
I
award
ten
points
to
Neville
Assuming
that
my
calculations
are
correct
I
believe
that
a
change
of
decoration
is
in
order
Gryffindor
wins
the
House
Cup
Not
Really
Going
Home

cant
let

this
year
Filch
Well
take
a
good
look
lads
This
night
might
well
be
the
last
you
spend
in
this
castle
Oh
dear
we
are
in
trouble
Snape
You
were
seen
by
no
less
than
seven
Muggles
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
serious
this
is
You
have
risked
the
exposure
of
our
world
Not
to
mention
the
damage
you
inflicted
on
a
Whomping
Willow
thats
been
on
these
grounds
since
before
you
were
born
Ron
Honestly
Professor
Snape
I
think
it
did
more
damage
to
us
Snape
Silence
I
assure
you
that
were
you
in
Slytherin
and
your
fate
rested
with
me
the
both
of
you
would
be
on
the
train
home
tonight
As
it
is
Dumbledore
They
are
not
Harry
Professor
Dumbledore
Professor
McGonagall
Snape
Headmaster
these
boys
have
flouted
the
Decree
for
the
Restriction
of
Underage
Wizardry
As
such
Dumbledore
Im
well
aware
of
our
bylaws
Severus
having
written
more
than
a
few
myself
However
as
Head
of
Gryffindor
House
it
is
for
Professor
McGonagall
to
determine
the
appropriate
action
Ron
Well
go
and
get
our
stuff
McGonagall
What
are
you
talking
about
Mr
Weasley
Ron
Well
youre
going
to
expel
us
arent
you
McGonagall
Not
today
Mr
Weasley
But
I
must
impress
upon
both
of
you
the
seriousness
of
what
you
have
done
I
will
be
writing
to
your
families
tonight
And
you
will
both
receive
detention
Dumbledore
And
now
I
suggest
that
we
all
return
to
the
feast
There
is
a
delicious
looking
custard
tart
that
I
am
most
anxious
to
sample
Harry

the
Gryffindor

to
buy
their

They
got
in

pure
talent
Draco
No

Eat

Ron
Hear

That
voice
Hermione
Voice
What
voice
Harry
I
heard
it
first
in
Lockharts
office
and
then
again
just
Ominous
Voice
Its
time
Harry
Its
moving
I
think
its
going
to
kill
Ron
Kill
Hermione
Harry
wait
Not
so
fast
Harry
Strange
Ive
never
seen
spiders
act
like
that
Ron
I
dont
like
spiders
Whats
that
Hermione
The
Chamber
of
Secrets
has
been
opened
Enemies
of
the
Heir

Its
written
in
blood
Harry
Oh

Its
Filchs
cat
Its
Mrs
Norris
Draco
Enemies
of
the
Heir
beware
Youll

next
Mudbloods
Filch
Whats
going
on
here
Go

make
way
Potter

you

Mrs
Norris
You

my
cat
Harry
No
No
Filch
Ill

you
Ill
kill
you
Dumbledore
Argus
Argus
I
Everyone
will
proceed
to
their
dormitories
immediately
Everyone
except
you
three
Ravenclaw
Prefect
Ravenclaws
follow
me
Dumbledore
Shes
not
dead
Argus
She
has
been
petrified
Lockhart
Ah
Thought
so
So
unlucky
I
wasnt
there
I
know
exactly
the
countercurse
that
couldve
spared
her
Dumbledore
But
how
she
has
been
petrified
I
cannot
say
Filch
Ask
him
Its
him
that
done
it
You
saw
what
he
wrote
on
the
wall
Harry
Its
not
true
sir
I
swear
I
never
touched
Mrs
Norris
Filch
Rubbish
Snape
If
I
might
headmaster
Perhaps
Potter
and
his
friends
were
simply
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
However
the
circumstances
are
suspicious
I
for
one
dont
recall
seeing
Potter
at
dinner
Lockhart
Im
afraid
thats
my
doing
Severus
You
see
Harry
was
helping
me
answer
my
fanmail
Hermione
Thats
why
Ron
and
I
went
looking
for
him
Professor
We
just
found
him
when
he
said
Snape
Yes
Ms
Granger
Harry
When
I
said
I
wasnt
hungry
We
were
heading
back
to
the
common
room
when
we
found
Mrs
Norris
Dumbledore
Innocent
until
proven
guilty
Severus
Filch
My
cat
has
been
petrified
I
want
to
see
some
punishment
Dumbledore
We
will
be
able
to
cure
her
Argus
As
I
understand
it
Madame
Sprout
has
a
very
healthy
growth
of
Mandrakes
When
matured
a
potion
will
be
made
which
will
revive
Mrs
Norris
And
in
the
meantime
I
strongly
recommend
caution
to
all
Hermione
Its
a
bit
strange
isnt
it
Harry
Strange
Hermione
You
hear
this
voice
a
voice
only
you
can
hear
and
then
Mrs
Norris
turns
up
petrified
Its
just
strange
Harry
You
think
I
shouldve
told
them
Dumbledore
and
the
others
I
mean
Ron
Are
you
mad
Hermione
No
Harry
Even
in
the
wizarding
world
hearing
voices
isnt
a
good
sign
Man
in
Painting
Shes
right
you
know
About
the
Chamber
McGonagall
Could
I
have
your
attention
please
Right
Now
today
we
will
be
transforming
animals
into
water
goblets
Like
so
One
two
three
Vera
Verto
Now
its
your
turn
Who
would
like
to
go
first
Ah
Mr
Weasley
One
two
three
Vera
Verto
Ron
Ahem
Vera
Verto
McGonagall
That
wand
needs
replacing
Mr
Weasley
Yes
Ms
Granger
Hermione
Professor
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
tell
us
about
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
McGonagall
Very
well
Well
you
all
know
of
course
that
Hogwarts
was
founded
over
a
thousand
years
ago
by
the
four
greatest
witches
and
wizards
of
the
age
Godric
Gryffindor
Helga
Hufflepuff
Rowena
Ravenclaw
and
Salazar
Slytherin
Now
three
of
the
founders
coexisted
quite
harmoniously
One
did
not
Ron
Three
guesses
who
McGonagall
Salazar
Slytherin
wished
to
be
more
selective
about
the
students
admitted
to
Hogwarts
He
believed
magical
learning
should
be
kept
within
all
magic
families
In
other
words
pure
bloods
Unable
to
sway
the
others
he
decided
to
leave
the
school
Now
according
to
legend
Slytherin
had
built
a
hidden
chamber
in
this
castle
known
as
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
Well
shortly
before
departing
he
sealed
it
until
that
time
when
his
own
true
heir
returned
to
the
school
The
Heir
alone
would
be
able
to
open
the
Chamber
and
unleash
the
horror
within
and
by
so
doing
purge
the
school
of
all
those
who
in
Slytherins
view
were
unworthy
to
study
magic
Hermione
Muggle
borns
McGonagall
Well
naturally
the
school
has
been
searched
many
times
No
such
Chamber
has
been
found
Hermione
Professor
what
exactly
does
legend
tell
us
lies
within
the
Chamber
McGonagall
Well
the
Chamber
is
said
to
be
home
to
something
that
only
the
Heir
of
Slytherin
can
control
It
is
said
to
be
the
home
of
a
monster
Ron
Do
you
think
its
true
Do
you
really
think
there
is
a
Chamber
of
Secrets
Hermione
Yes
Couldnt
you
tell
McGonagalls
worried
All
the
teachers
are
Harry
But
if
there
really
is
a
Chamber
of
Secrets
and
it
really
has
been
opened
then
that
means
Hermione
The
Heir
of
Slytherin
has
returned
to
Hogwarts
The
question
is
who
is
it
Ron
Lets
think
who
do
we
know
who
thinks
all
Muggle
borns
are
scum
Hermione
If
youre
talking
about
Malfoy
Ron
Of
course
You
heard
him
Youll
be
next
mudbloods
Hermione
I
heard
him
But
Malfoy
the
Heir
of
Slytherin
Harry
Well
maybe
Rons
right
Hermione
I
mean
look
at
his
family
the
whole
lot
of
them
have
been
in
Slytherin
for
centuries
Ron
Crabbe
and
Goyle
must
know
Maybe
we
could
trick
them
into
telling
Hermione
Even
they
arent
that
thick
But
there
might
be
another
way
Mind
you
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
mention
wed
be
breaking
fifty
school
rules
and
itll
be
dangerous
very
dangerous
Rogue
bludger
Hermione
Here
it
is
the
Polyjuice
Potion
Properly
brewed
the
Polyjuice
Potion
allows
the
drinker
to
transform
himself
temporarily
into
the
physical
form
of
another
Ron
You
mean
if
Harry
and
I
drink
that
stuff
well
turn
into
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Hermione
Yes
Ron
Wicked
Malfoy
will
tell
us
anything
Hermione
Exactly
but
its
tricky
Ive
never
seen
a
more
complicated
potion
Harry
Well
how
long
will
it
take
to
make
Hermione
A
month
Harry
A
month
But
Hermione
if
Malfoy
is
the
Heir
of
Slytherin
he
could
attack
half
the
Muggle
borns
in
the
school
by
then
Hermione
I
know
but
its
the
only
plan
weve
got
No
longer
safe
Harry
Thank
you
Hermione
Are
you
okay
Harry
No
I
think
my
I
think
my
arms
broken
Lockhart

worry
Harry

will
fix
that
arm
of
yours

away
Harry

Not

the
butterflies
Spider

Harry

My
sons

daughters

not

Hagrid
on
my
command
But
I
cannot
deny
them
fresh
meat
when
it
wanders

willingly
into
our
midst
Goodbye
friend
of
Hagrid
Ron
Can

panic
now
Know
any
spells
Harry
One
but
its
not
powerful

for
all
of

Ron

Ron
Follow

Follow
the
spiders
If
Hagrid
ever
gets
out
of
Azkaban
Ill
kill
him
I
mean
what
was
the
point
of
sending
us
in
there
What
have
we
found
out
Harry
We
know
one
thing
Hagrid
never
opened
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
he
was
innocent
Missing
Harry
Wish
you
were
here
Hermione
We
need
you
Now
more
than
ever
Ron
Whats
that
Harry
Ron
this
is
why
Hermione
was
in
the
library
the
day
she
was
attacked
Come
on
Of
the
many
fearsome
beasts
that
roam
our
land
none
is
more
deadly
than
the
Basilisk
Capable
of
living
for
hundreds
of
years
instant
death
awaits
any
who
meet
this
giant
serpents
eye
Spiders
flee
before
it

Ron
this
is
it
The
monster
in
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
is
a
Basilisk
Thats
why
I
can
hear
it
speak
Its
a
snake
Ron
But
if
it
kills
by
looking
people
in
the
eye
why
is
it
no
ones
dead
Harry
Because
no
one
did
look
it
in
the
eye
Not
directly
at
least
Colin
saw
it
through
his
camera
Justin
Justin
mustve
seen
the
Basilisk
through
Nearly
Headless
Nick
Nick
got
the
full
blast
of
it
but
hes
a
ghost
He
couldnt
die
again
And
Hermione
had
the
mirror
I
bet
you
anything
she
was
using
it
to
look
around
corners
in
case
it
came
along
Ron
And
Mrs
Norris
Im
pretty
sure
she
didnt
have
a
camera
or
a
mirror
Harry
Harry
The
water
There
was
water
on
the
floor
that
night
She
only
saw
the
Basilisks
reflection
Spiders
flee
before
it
It
all
fits
Ron
But
hows
the
Basilisk
been
getting
around
A
dirty
great
snake
someone
wouldve
seen
it
Harry
Hermiones
answered
that
too
Ron
Pipes
Its
using
the
plumbing
Harry
Remember
what
Aragog
said
about
that
girl
fifty
years
ago
she
died
in
a
bathroom
What
if
she
never
left
Ron
Moaning
Myrtle
Professor
McGonagall
All
students
are
to
return
to
their
house
dormitories
at
once
All
teachers
to
the
second
floor
corridor
immediately
Professor
McGonagall
As
you
can
see
the
Heir
of
Slytherin
has
left
another
message
Our
worst
fear
has
been
realized
a
student
has
been
taken
by
the
monster
into
the
Chamber
itself
The
students
must
be
sent
home
Im
afraid
this
is
the
end
of
Hogwarts
Lockhart
So
sorry
Dozed
off
What
have
I
missed
Snape
A
girl
has
been
snatched
by
the
monster
Lockhart
Your
moment
has
come
at
last
Lockhart
My
moment
Snape
Werent
you
saying
just
last
night
youve
known
all
along
where
the
entrance
to
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
is
Professor
McGonagall
Thats
settled
Well
leave
you
to
deal
with
the
monster
Gilderoy
Your
skills
after
all
are
legend
Lockhart
Very
well
Ill
just
be
in
my
office
getting
uh
getting
ready
Madam
Pomfrey
Who
is
it
that
the
monsters
taken
Minerva
Professor
McGonagall
Ginny
Weasley
Ron
Her
skeleton
will
lie
in
the
Chamber
forever
Ginny
Chamber
of
Secrets
Harry
Lockhart
may
be
useless
but
hes
going
to
try
to
get
into
the
Chamber
At
least
we
can
tell
him
what
we
know
Professor
we
have
some
information
for
you
Are
you
going
somewhere
Lockhart
Um
well
yes
Urgent
call
Unavoidable
Uh
got
to
go
Ron
What
about
my
sister
Lockhart
Uh
well
um
As
to
that
most
unfortunate
No
one
regrets
more
than
I
Ron
Youre
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
You
cant
go
now
Lockhart
Well
I
must
say
when
I
took
the
job
there
was
nothing
in
the
job
description
about
Harry
Youre
running
away
After
all
that
stuff
you
did
in
your
books
Lockhart
Books
can
be
misleading
Harry
You
wrote
them
Lockhart
My
dear
boy
do
use
your
common
sense
My
books
wouldnt
have
sold
half
as
well
if
people
didnt
think
Id
done
all
those
things
Harry
Youre
a
fraud
Youve
just
been
taking
credit
for
what
other
wizards
have
done
Ron
Is
there
anything
you
can
do
Lockhart
Yes
Now
you
mention
it
Im
rather
gifted
with
memory
charms
Otherwise
you
see
all
those
wizards
wouldve
gone
blabbing
and
Id
never
have
sold
another
book
In
fact
uh
Im
uh
going
to
have
to
do
the
same
to
you
Harry
Dont
even
think
about
it
Myrtle
Oh
Whos
there
Oh
hello
Harry
What
do
you
want
Harry
To
ask
you
how
you
died
Myrtle
Oh
it
was
dreadful
It
happened
right
here
in
this
very
cubicle
Id
hidden
because
Olive
Hornby
was
teasing
me
about
my
glasses
I
was
crying
and
then
I
heard
somebody
come
in
Harry
Who
was
it
Myrtle
Myrtle
I
dont
know
I
was
distraught
But
they
said
something
funny
a
kind
of
made
up
language
and
I
realized
it
was
a
boy
speaking
so
I
unlocked
the
door
to
tell
him
to
go
away
and
I
died
Harry
Just
like
that
How
Myrtle
I
just
remember
seeing
a
pair
of
great
big
yellow
eyes
over
there
by
that
sink
Harry
This
is
it
This
is
it
Ron
I
think
this
is
the
entrance
to
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
Ron
Say
something
Harry
say
something
in
Parseltongue
Harry
Hesha
Hassah
Open
up
Lockhart
Excellent
Harry
Ah

work
Well
then
Ill
just
be
uh
theres
no
need
for
me
to
stay
Harry
Oh
yes
there
is
You
first
Lockhart
Now
boys
what
good
will
it
do
Ron
Better
you
than
us
Lockhart
Um
but
obviously
yes
Sure
you
dont
want
to
test
it
first
Its
really
quite
filthy
down
here
Harry
All
right
Lets
go
Myrtle
Oh
Harry
If
you
die
down
there
youre
welcome
to
share
my
toilet
Harry
Uh
thanks
Myrtle
Ron
Ugh
Harry
Now
remember
any
sign
of
movement
close
your
eyes
straight
away
Ron
Go
on
Backfire
Harry
This
way

Heir
of
Slytherin

Ginny
Ginny
No
Ginny
Please

Wake

Please

Riddle
She
wont

Harry
Tom
Tom
Riddle
What
do
you
mean
she
wont
wake
Shes
not

Riddle
Shes
still
alive
but
only
just
Harry
Are
you
a
ghost
Riddle
A
memory
preserved
in
a
diary
for
fifty
years
Harry
Shes
as
cold
as
ice
Ginny
please
dont
be
dead
Wake
up
Youve
got
to
help
me
Tom
Theres
a
Basilisk
Riddle
It
wont
come
until
its
called
Harry
Give
me
my
wand
Tom
Riddle
You
wont
be
needing
it
Harry
Listen
weve
got
to
go
Weve
got
to
save
her
Riddle
Im
afraid
I
cant
do
that
Harry
You
see
as
poor
Ginny
grows
weaker
I
grow
stronger
Yes
Harry
It
was
Ginny
Weasley
who
opened
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
Harry
No
She
couldnt
She
wouldnt
Riddle
It
was
Ginny
who
set
the
Basilisk
on
the
Mudbloods
and
Filchs
cat
Ginny
who
wrote
the
threatening
messages
on
the
walls
Harry
But
why
Riddle
Because
I
told
her
to
Youll
find
I
can
be
very
persuasive
Not
that
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
She
was
shall
we
say
in
a
kind
of
trance
Still
the
power
of
the
diary
began
to
scare
her
And
she
tried
to
dispose
of
it
in
the
girls
bathroom
And
then
who
should
find
it
but
you
The
very
person
I
was
most
anxious
to
meet
Harry
And
why
did
you
want
to
meet
me
Riddle
I
knew
I
had
to
talk
to
you
meet
you
if
I
could
So
I
decided
to
show
you
my
capture
of
that
brainless
oaf
Hagrid
to
gain
your
trust
Harry
Hagrids
my
friend
And
you
framed
him
didnt
you
Riddle
It
was
my
word
against
Hagrids
Only
Dumbledore
seemed
to
think
he
was
innocent
Harry
Ill
bet
Dumbledore
saw
right
through
you
Riddle
He
certainly
kept
an
annoyingly
close
watch
on
me
after
that
I
knew
it
wouldnt
be
safe
to
open
the
Chamber
again
while
I
was
still
at
school
so
I
decided
to
leave
behind
a
diary
preserving
my
sixteen
year
old
self
in
its
pages
so
that
one
day
I
would
be
able
to
lead
another
to
finish
Salazar
Slytherins
noble
work
Harry
Well
you
havent
finished
it
this
time
In
a
few
hours
the
Mandrake
draught
will
be
ready
And
everyone
who
was
Petrified
will
be
all
right
again
Riddle
Havent
I
told
you
Killing
Mudbloods
doesnt
matter
to
me
anymore
For
many
months
now
my
new
target
has
been
you
How
is
it
that
a
baby
with
no
extraordinary
magical
talent
was
able
to
defeat
the
greatest
wizard
of
all
time
How
did
you
escape
with
nothing
but
a
scar
while
Lord
Voldemorts
powers
were
destroyed
Harry
Why
do
you
care
how
I
escaped
Voldemort
was
after
your
time
Riddle
Voldemort
is
my
past
present
and
future
Harry
You
Youre
the
Heir
of
Slytherin
Youre
Voldemort
Riddle
Surely
you
didnt
think
I
was
going
to
keep
my
filthy
Muggle
fathers
name
No
I
fashioned
myself
a
new
name
a
name
I
knew
wizards
everywhere
would
one
day
fear
to
speak
when
I
became
the
greatest
sorcerer
in
the
world
Harry
Albus
Dumbledore
is
the
greatest
sorcerer
in
the
world
Riddle
Dumbledores
been
driven
out
of
this
castle
by
the
mere
memory
of
me
Harry
Hell
never
be
gone
Not
as
long
as
those
who
remain
are
loyal
to
him
Fawkes
Riddle
So
this
is
what
Dumbledore
sends
his
great
defender
A
songbird
and
an
old
hat
Shearhas
Samnathas
Slithaeine
Speak
to
me
Slytherin
greatest
of
the
Hogwarts
four
The
Basilisk
Riddle
Lets
match
the
power
of
Lord
Voldemort
Heir
of
Salazar
Slytherin
against
the
famous
Harry
Potter
Riddle
Sethae
He
This
Kill
him
Parseltongue
wont
save
you
now
Potter
It
only
obeys
me
Riddle
No
Your
bird
may
have
blinded
the
Basilisk
but
it
can
still
hear
you
Riddle
Yes
Potter
The
process
is
nearly
complete
In
a
few
minutes
Ginny
Weasley
will
be
dead
and
I
will
cease
to
be
a
memory
Lord
Voldemort
will
return
very
much
alive
Harry
Ginny
Harry
No
Riddle
Remarkable
isnt
it
How
quickly
the
venom
of
the
Basilisk
penetrates
the
body
I
guess
you
have
little
more
than
a
minute
to
live
Youll
be
with
your
dear
Mudblood
mother
soon
Harry
Funny
the
damage
a
silly
little
book
can
do
especially
in
the
hands
of
a
silly
little
girl
What
are
you
doing
Stop
No
Harry
Ginny
Ginny
Harry
it
was
me
But
I
swear
I
didnt
mean
to
Riddle
made
me
And
Harry
youre
hurt
Harry
Dont
worry
Ginny
you
need
to
get
yourself
out
Follow
the
Chamber
and
youll
find
Ron
You
were
brilliant
Fawkes
I
just
wasnt
quick
enough
Of
course
Phoenix
tears
have
healing
powers
Thanks
Its
all
right
Ginny
Its
over
Its
just
a
memory
Lockhart
Amazing
This
is
just
like
magic
Out
of
the
Hat
Professor
Dumbledore
You
both
realize
of
course
that
in
the
past
few
hours
you
have
broken
perhaps
a
dozen
school
rules
Harry
and
Ron
Yes
sir
Professor
Dumbledore
And
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
have
you
both
expelled
Harry
and
Ron
Yes
sir
Professor
Dumbledore
Therefore
it
is
only
fitting
that
you
both
receive
special
awards
for
services
to
the
school
Ron
Thanks
sir
Professor
Dumbledore
And
now
Mr
Weasley
if
you
would
have
an
owl
deliver
these
release
papers
to
Azkaban
I
believe
we
we
want
our
gamekeeper
back
Harry
first
I
want
to
thank
you
Harry
You
mustve
shown
me
real
loyalty
down
in
the
Chamber
Nothing
but
that
couldve
called
Fawkes
to
you
And
second
I
sense
something
is
troubling
you
Am
I
right
Harry
Harry
You
see
sir
I
couldnt
help
but
notice
certain
things
certain
certain
similarities
between
Tom
Riddle
and
me
Professor
Dumbledore
I
see
Well
you
can
speak
Parseltongue
Harry
Why
Because
Lord
Voldemort
can
speak
Parseltongue
If
Im
not
mistaken
Harry
he
transferred
some
of
his
powers
to
you
the
night
he
gave
you
that
scar
Harry
Voldemort
transferred
some
of
his
powers
to
me
Professor
Dumbledore
Uh
huh
Not
intentionally
But
yes
Harry
So
the
Sorting
Hat
was
right
I
should
be
in
Slytherin
Professor
Dumbledore
Its
true
Harry
You
possess
many
of
the
qualities
that
Voldemort
himself
prizes
Determination
resourcefulness
and
if
I
may
so
a
certain
disregard
for
the
rules
Why
then
did
the
Sorting
Hat
place
you
in
Gryffindor
Harry
Because
I
asked
it
to
Professor
Dumbledore
Exactly
Harry
exactly
Which
makes
you
different
from
Voldemort
It
is
not
our
abilities
that
show
what
we
truly
are
it
is
our
choices
If
you
want
proof
why
you
belong
in
Gryffindor
then
I
suggest
you
look
more
closely
at
this
Be
careful
Harry
Godric
Gryffindor
Professor
Dumbledore
Ah
It
would
take
a
true
Gryffindor
to
pull
that
out
of
the
hat
Dobbys
Reward
Harry
Dobby
So
this
is
your
master
The
family
you
serve
is
the
Malfoys
Dobby
Mm
hmm
Lucius
Ill
deal
with
you
later
Out
of
my
way
Potter
So
its
true
You
have
returned
Professor
Dumbledore
When
the
governors
learned
that
Arthur
Weasleys
daughter
was
taken
into
the
Chamber
they
saw
fit
to
summon
me
back
Lucius

my

little
south
of
Sheffield
circling
a
chimney
stack
The
Accidental
Magic
Reversal
Department
was
dispatched
immediately
She
has
been
properly
punctured
and
her
memory
modified
She
will
have
no
recollection
of
the
incident
whatsoever

Harry
Mr

a
word
Harry
Yeah

Arthur
Hermione
Hermione
Good
morning
Mr
Weasley
Arthur
Looking
forward
to
a
new
term
Harry
Yeah
It
should
be
great
Arthur
Harry
some
within
the
Ministry
would
strongly
discourage
me
from
divulging
what
Im
about
to
reveal
to
you
But
I
think
that
you
need
to
know
the
facts
You
are
in
danger
Grave
danger
Harry
Has
this
anything
to
do
with
Sirius
Black
sir
Arthur
What
do
you
know
about
Sirius
Black
Harry
Harry
Only
that
hes
escaped
from
Azkaban
Arthur
Do
you
know
why
Thirteen
years
ago
when
you
stopped
Harry
Voldemort
Arthur
Dont
say
his
name
Harry
Sorry
Arthur
When
you
stopped
You
Know
Who
Black
lost
everything
But
to
this
day
he
still
remains
a
faithful
servant
And
in
his
mind
you
are
the
only
thing
that
stands
in
the
way
of
You
Know
Who
returning
to
power
And
that
is
why
he
has
escaped
from
Azkaban
To
find
you
Harry
And
kill
me
Arthur
Harry
swear
to
me
that
whatever
you
might
hear
you
wont
go
looking
for
Black
Harry
Mr
Weasley
why
would
I
go
looking
for
someone
who
wants
to
kill
me
Molly
Quick
Quick
Ron
Ron
Oh
for
goodness
sake
Dont
lose
him
Harry
I
didnt
mean
to
blow
her
up
I
just
I
lost
control
Ron
Brilliant
Hermione
Honestly
Ron
its
not
funny
Harry
was
lucky
not
to
be
expelled
Harry
I
think
I
was
lucky
not
to
be
arrested
actually
Ron
I
still
think
it
was
brilliant
Hermione
Come
on
Everywhere
else
is
full
Ron
Who
do
you
think
that
is
Hermione
Professor
RJ
Lupin
Ron
Do
you
know
everything
How
is
it
she
knows
everything
Hermione
Its
on
his
suitcase
Ronald
Ron
Oh
Harry
Do
you
think
hes
really
asleep
Hermione
Seems
to
be
Why
Harry
I
gotta
tell
you
something
Ron
Let
me
get
this
straight
Sirius
Black
has
escaped
from
Azkaban
to
come
after
you
Harry
Yeah
Hermione
But
theyll
catch
Black
wont
they
I
mean
everyones
looking
for
him
Ron
Sure
Except
no
ones
ever
broken
out
of
Azkaban
before
and
hes
a
murderous
raving
lunatic
Harry
Thanks
Ron
Hermione
Why
are
we
stopping
We
cant
be
there
yet
Ron
Whats
going

Harry
I
dont
know
Maybe
weve
broken
down
Hermione
Ouch
Ron
That
was
my
foot
Ron
Theres
something
moving
out
there
I
think
someones
coming
aboard
Ron
Bloody
hell
Whats
happening
Hermione
Harry
Harry
are
you
all
right
Harry
Thank
you
Lupin
Here
eat
this
Itll
help
Its
all
right
Its
chocolate
Harry
What
was
that
thing
that
came
Lupin
It
was
a
dementor
One
of
the
guards
of
Azkaban
Its
gone
now
It
was
searching
the
train
for
Sirius
Black
If
youll
excuse
me
I
need
to
have
a
little
word
with
the
driver
Eat
Youll
feel
better
Harry
What
happened
to
me
Ron
Well
you
sort
of
went
rigid
We
thought
maybe
you
were
having
a
fit
or
something
Harry
And
did
either
of
you
two
you
know
pass
out
Ron
No
I
felt
weird
though
Like
Id
never
be
cheerful
again
Harry
But
someone
was
screaming
A
woman
Hermione
No
one
was
screaming
Harry
Dumbledore
Welcome
Welcome
to
another
year
at
Hogwarts
Now
Id
like
to
say
a
few
words
before
we
all
become
too
befuddled
by
our
excellent
feast
First
Im
pleased
to
welcome
Professor
RJ
Lupin
whos
kindly
consented
to
fill
the
post
of
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Good
luck
Professor
Hermione
Of
course
Thats
why
he
knew
to
give
you
the
chocolate
Harry
Malfoy
Potter
Is
it
true
you
fainted
I
mean
you
actually
fainted
Ron
Shove
off
Malfoy
Harry
How
did
he
find
out
Hermione
Just
forget
it
Dumbledore
Our
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
has
decided
to
retire
in
order
to
spend
more
time
with
his
remaining
limbs
Fortunately
Im
delighted
to
announce
that
his
place
will
be
taken
by
none
other
than
our
own
Rubeus
Hagrid
Finally
on
a
more
disquieting
note
at
the
request
of
the
Ministry
of
Magic
Hogwarts
will
until
further
notice
play
host
to
the
dementors
of
Azkaban
until
such
a
time
as
Sirius
Black
is
captured
The
dementors
will
be
stationed
at
every
entrance
to
the
grounds
Now
whilst
Ive
been
assured
that
their
presence
will
not
disrupt
our
day
to
day
activities
a
word
of
caution
Dementors
are
vicious
creatures
Theyll
not
distinguish
between
the
one
they
hunt
and
the
one
who
gets
in
their
way
Therefore
I
must
warn
each
and
every
one
of
you
to
give
them
no
reason
to
harm
you
It
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
dementor
to
be
forgiving
But
you
know
happiness
can
be
found
even
in
the
darkest
of
times
if
one
only
remembers
to
turn
on
the
light
Seamus
Fortuna
Major
Here
listen
She
just
wont
let
me
in
Fortuna
Major
Fat
Lady
No
no
no
Wait
wait
Watch
this
Oh
amazing
Just
with
my
voice
Harry
Fortuna
Major
Fat
Lady
Yes
all
right
Go

Harry
Thank
you
HarrySeamus
Shes

that
after

years
She
cant
even
sing
Exactly
Hey

Hey

Oh

Ron
Green
Thats

monkey
What

You

monkey
Do

give
him
one
again
Hey
Neville

elephant
Seamus
Ron

Ron

Seamus
I
think
we

a
winner
Ron
Oh

one
of
them
Oh

Look
at
him
His
face
Trelawney
Welcome
my
children
In
this
room
you
shall
explore
the
noble
art
of
Divination
In
this
room
you
shall
discover
if
you
possess
the
Sight
Hello
I
am
Professor
Trelawney
Together
we
shall
cast
ourselves
into
the
future
This
term
well
focus
on
Tasseomancy
the
art
of
reading
tea
leaves
So
please
take
the
cup
of
the
person
sitting
opposite
you
What
do
you
see
The
truth
lies
buried
like
a
sentence
deep
within
a
book
waiting
to
be
read
But
first
you
must
broaden
your
minds
First
you
must
look
beyond
Hermione
What
a
load
of
rubbish
Ron
Where
did
you
come
from
Hermione
Me
Ive
been
here
all
this
time
Trelawney
You
boy
Is
your
grandmother
quite
well
Neville
I
think

Trelawney
I
wouldnt
be
so
sure
of
that
Give
me
the
cup
Pity
Broaden
your
minds
Your
aura
is
pulsing
dear
Are
you
in
the
beyond
I
think

Ron

Trelawney
Look
at
the
cup
Tell
me
what
you

Ron
Oh

Um
Well
Harrys

sort
of
a
wonky
cross
Thats
trials
and
suffering
And
that
there
could
be
the
sun
and
thats
happiness
So
youre
gonna
suffer
but
youre
gonna
be
happy
about
it
Trelawney
Give
me
the
cup
Oh
my
dear
boy
My
dear
you

the
Grim
Other
The
Grin
Whats
the
Grin
Not
the
Grin
you
idiot
The
Grim
Taking
form
of
a
giant
spectral
dog
Its
among
the
darkest
omens
in
our
world
Its
an
omen
of
death
Ron
You
dont
think
that
Grim
things
got
anything
to
do
with
Sirius
Black
Hermione
Oh
honestly
Ron
If
you
ask
me
Divinations
a
woolly
discipline
Now
Ancient
Runes
thats
a
fascinating
subject
Ron
Ancient
Runes
Exactly
how
many
classes
are
you
taking
Hermione
A
fair
few
Ron
Hang
on
Thats
not
possible
Ancient
Runes
is
in
the
same
time
as
Divination
You
have
to
be
in
two
classes
at
once
Hermione
Dont
be
silly
Ron
How
could
anyone
be
in
two
classes
at
once
Broaden
your
minds
Use
your
Inner
Eye
to
see
the
future
Hagrid
Thats
it
Come

Less

Neville

Isnt

beautiful
Say
hello
to
Buckbeak
Ron
Hagrid
exactly
what
is
that
Hagrid
That
Ron
is
a
hippogriff
First
thing
you
wanna
know
about
hippogriffs
is
that
theyre
very
proud
creatures
Very
easily
offended
You
do
not
want
to
insult
a
hippogriff
It
may
just
be
the
last
thing
you
ever
do
Now
whod
like
to
come
and
say
hello
Well
done
Harry
Well
done
Come
on
now
Now
you
have
to
let
him
make
the
first
move
Its
only
polite
So
step
up
Give
him
a
nice
bow
Then
you
wait
and
see
if
he
bows
back
If
he
does
you
can
go
and
touch
him
If
not
Well
well

bow
Nice

Hermione
Hagrid
He

the
hospital
Hagrid
Im

Malfoy
Oh
Youre
gonna
regret
this
Hagrid
Class
dismissed
Malfoy
You
and
your
bloody
chicken
PANSY
Does
it
hurt
terribly
Draco
Malfoy
It
comes
and
it
goes
Still
I
consider
myself
lucky
Madam
Pomfrey
said
another
minute
and
I
couldve
lost
my
arm
I
couldnt
do
homework
for
weeks
Ron
Listen
to
the
idiot
Hes
really
laying
it
on
thick
isnt
he
Harry
At
least
Hagrid
didnt
get
fired
Hermione
Yeah
but
I
heard
Dracos
fathers
furious
We
havent
heard
the
end
of
this
Seamus
Hes
been
sighted
Hes
been
sighted
Ron
Who
Seamus
Sirius
Black
Hermione
Dufftown
Thats
not
far
from
here
Other
You
dont
think
hed
come
to
Hogwarts
do
you
With
dementors
at
every
entrance
Seamus
Dementors
Hes
already
slipped
past
them
once
Whos
to
say
he
wont
do
it
again
Other
Thats
right
Black
could
be
anywhere
Its
like
trying
to
catch
smoke
Like
trying
to
catch
smoke
with
your
bare
hands
Lupin
Intriguing
isnt
it
Would
anyone
like
to
venture
a
guess
as
to
what
is
inside
Dean
Thats
a
boggart
that
is
Lupin
Very
good
Mr
Thomas
Now
can
anybody
tell
me
what
a
boggart
looks
like
Hermione
No
one
knows
Ron
When
did
she
get
here
Hermione
Boggarts
are
shape
shifters
They
take
the
shape
of
whatever
a
particular
person
fears
the
most
Thats
what
makes
them
so
Lupin
So
terrifying
yes
yes
yes
Luckily
a
very
simple
charm
exists
to
repel
a
boggart
Lets
practice
it
now
Without
wands
please
After
me
Riddikulus
Other
Riddikulus
Lupin
Very
good
A
little
louder
and
very
clear
Listen
Riddikulus
Other
Riddikulus
Malfoy
This
class
is
ridiculous
Lupin
Very
good
So
much
for
the
easy
part
You
see
the
incantation
alone
is
not
enough
What
really
finishes
a
boggart
is
laughter
You
need
to
force
it
to
assume
a
shape
you
find
truly
amusing
Let
me
explain
Uh
Neville
would
you
join
me
please
Come
on
dont
be
shy
Come
on
Come
on
Hello
Neville

frightens
you

of
all
Neville
Professor
Snape

Lupin
Professor
Snape
Yes
frightens
all
And
I
believe
you
live
with
your
grandmother
Neville
Y
Yes
but
I
dont
want
that
boggart
to
turn
into
her
either
Lupin
No
it
wont
I
want
you
to
picture
her
clothes
Only
her
clothes
very
clearly
in
your
mind
Neville
She
carries
a
red
handbag
Lupin
We
dont
need
to
hear
As
long
as
you
see
it
well
see
it
Now
when
I
open
that
wardrobe
heres
what
I
want
you
to
do
Excuse
me
Imagine
Professor
Snape
in
your
grandmothers
clothes
Can
you
do
that
Yes
Wand

the
ready
One

Think
Neville

Neville
Riddikulus
Lupin
Wonderful
Neville

Incredible
Okay

the
back
Neville
Everyone
form
a
line
Form

line
I
want
everyone
to
picture
the
thing
they
fear
the
very
most

turn
it
into
something
funny
Next
Ron
Concentrate
Face

fear
Be
brave
Wand

ready
Ron
wand

Ron
Riddikulus
Lupin

Absolutely

Steady
Parvate
Riddikulus
Lupin
And

Step

Wonderful

Riddikulus
Right
Sorry

that
Thats
enough
for
today
Collect
your
books
from
the
back
Thats
the
end
of
the
lesson
Thank
you
Sorry
Sorry
you
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
McGonagall
Now
remember
these
visits
to
Hogsmeade
village
are
a
privilege
Should
your
behavior
reflect
poorly
on
the
school
in
anyway
that
privilege
shall
not
be
extended
again
No
permission
form
signed
no
visiting
the
village
Thats
the
rule
Potter
Flitch
Those
with
permission
follow
me
Those
without
stay
put
Harry
But
professor
I
thought
if
you
signed
it
then
I
could
McGonagall
I
cant
Only
a
parent
or
a
guardian
can
sign
Since
I
am
neither
it
would
be
inappropriate
Im
sorry
Potter
Thats
my
final
word
Harry
Forget
about
it
guys
See
you
later
Harry
Professor
can
I
ask
you
something
Lupin
You
want
to
know
why
I
stopped
you
facing
that
boggart
yes
I
wouldve
thought
itd
be
obvious
I
assumed
it
would
take
the
shape
of
Lord
Voldemort
Harry
I
did
think
of
Voldemort
at
first
But
then
I
remembered
that
night
on
the
train
and
the
dementor
Lupin
Im
very
impressed
That
suggests
what
you
fear
the
most
is
fear
itself
This
is
very
wise
Harry
Before
I
fainted
I
heard
something
A
woman
screaming
Lupin
Dementors
force
us
to
relive
our
very
worst
memories
Our
pain
becomes
their
power
Harry
I
think
it
was
my
mother
the
night
she
was
murdered
Lupin
The
very
first
time
I
saw
you
Harry
I
recognized
you
immediately
Not
by
your
scar
by
your
eyes
Theyre
your
mother
Lilys
Yes
Oh
yes
I
knew
her
Your
mother
was
there
for
me
at
a
time
when
no
one
else
was
Not
only
was
she
a
singularly
gifted
witch
she
was
also
an
uncommonly
kind
woman
She
had
a
way
of
seeing
the
beauty
in
others
even
and
perhaps
most
especially
when
that
person
could
not
see
it
in
themselves
And
your
father
James
on
the
other
hand
he
He
had
a
certain
shall
we
say
talent
for
trouble
A
talent
rumor
has
it
he
passed
on
to

Fat

Eyes

Its

headmaster
The

Hes

in
the
castle
Sirius
Black
Dumbledore
Secure

castle
Mr
Filch
The
rest
of
you
to
the
Great
Hall
Flitch
Ive
searched
the
Astronomy
Tower
and
the
Owlery
sir
But
theres
nothing
there
Dumbledore
Ah
thank
you
Flitwick
The
third
floors
clear
too
sir
Dumbledore
Very
good
Snape
Ive
done
the
dungeons
headmaster
No
sign
of
Black
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
castle
Dumbledore
I
didnt
really
expect
him
to
linger
Snape
Remarkable
feat
dont
you
think
To
enter
Hogwarts
Castle
on
ones
own
completely
undetected
Dumbledore
Quite
remarkable
yes
Snape
Any
theories
on
how
he
managed
it
Dumbledore
Many
Each
as
unlikely
as
the
next
Snape
You
may
recall
prior
to
the
start
of
term
I
expressed
concerns
about
your
appointment
of
Professor
Dumbledore
Not
a
single
professor
inside
this
castle
would
help
Sirius
Black
enter
it
Im
quite
convinced
the
castle
is
safe
and
Im
more
than
willing
to
send
the
students
back
to
their
houses
Snape
What
about
Potter
Should
he
be
warned
Dumbledore
Perhaps
But
for
now
let
him
sleep
For
in
dreams
we
enter
a
world
thats
entirely
our
own
Let
them
swim
in
the
deepest
ocean
or
glide
over
the
highest
cloud
Snape
Turn
to
page

Harry
Excuse
me
sir
Wheres
Professor
Lupin
Snape
Thats
not
really
your
concern
is
it
Potter
Suffice
it
to
say
your
professor
finds
himself
incapable
of
teaching
at
the
present
time
Turn

Ron
Werewolves
Hermione
But
sir
we
just
learned
about
red
caps
and
hinkypunks
Were
not
meant
to
start
that
for
weeks
Snape
Quiet
Ron
When
did
she
come
in
Did
you
see
her
come
in
Snape
Now
which
one
of
you
can
tell
me
the
difference
between
an
Animagus
and
a
werewolf
No
one
How
disappointing
Hermione
Please
sir
An
Animagus
is
a
wizard
who
elects
to
turn
into
an
animal
A
werewolf
has
no
choice
With
each
full
moon
when
he
transforms
he
no
longer
remembers
who
he
is
Hed
kill
his
best
friend
if
he
crossed
his
path
Furthermore
the
werewolf
only
responds
to
the
call
of
its
own
kind
Snape
Thank
you
Mr
Malfoy
Thats
the
second
time
youve
spoken
out
of
turn
Miss
Granger
Are
you
incapable
of
restraining
yourself
or
do
you
take
pride
in
being
an
insufferable
know
it
all
Ron
Hes
got
a
point
you
know
Snape
Five
points
from
Gryffindor
As
an
antidote
to
your
ignorance
and
on
my
desk
by
Monday
morning
two
rolls
of
parchment
on
the
werewolf
with
emphasis
on
recognizing
it
Harry
Sir
its
Quidditch
tomorrow
Snape
Then
I
suggest
you
take
extra
care
Mr
Potter
Loss
of
limb
will
not
excuse
you

The
term
werewolf
is
a
contraction
of
the
Anglo
Saxon
word
were
which
means
man
and
wolf
Werewolf
man
wolf
There
are
several
ways
to
become
a
werewolf
They
include
being
given
the
power
of
shape
shifting
being
bitten
by
a
werewolf
Hermione
Go
Harry
Go
Harry
Dumbledore
Arresto
momentum
Ron
He
looks
a
bit
peaky
doesnt
he
Fred
Peaky
What
do
you
expect
He
fell
over

feet
George
Yeah
come
on
Ron
lets
walk
you
off
the
astronomy
tower
and
see
what
you
look
like
Harry
Probably
a
right
sight
better
than
he
normally
does
Hermione
How
are
you
feeling
Harry
Oh
brilliant
Fred
You
gave
us
a
right
good
scare
there
mate
Harry
What
happened
Ron
Well
you
fell
off
your
broom
Harry
Really
I
meant
the
match
Who
won
Hermione
Umm
no
one
blames
you
Harry
The
dementors
arent
supposed
to
come
inside
the
grounds
Dumbledores
furious
As
soon
as
he
saved
you
he
sent
them
off
Ron
Theres
something
else
you
should
know
too
When
you
fell
your
broom
sort
of
blew
into
the
Whomping
Willow
and
Well
Lupin
Im
sorry
to
hear
about
your
broomstick
Is
there
no
chance
of
fixing
it
Harry
No
Professor
why
do
the
dementors
affect
me
so
I
mean
more
than
everyone
else
Lupin
Listen
Dementors
are
amongst
the
foulest
creatures
to
walk
this
earth
They
feed
on
every
good
feeling
every
happy
memory
until
a
person
is
left
with
absolutely
nothing
but
his
worst
experiences
You
are
not
weak
Harry
The
dementors
affect
you
most
because
there
are
true
horrors
in
your
past
Horrors
your
classmates
can
scarcely
imagine
You
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
Harry
Im
scared
professor
Lupin
Well
Id
consider
you
a
fool
if
you
werent
Harry
I
need
to
know
how
to
fight
them
You
could
teach
me
You
made
that
dementor
on
the
train
go
away
Lupin
There
was
only
one
that
night
Harry
But
you
made
it
go
away
Lupin
I
dont
pretend
to
be
an
expert
Harry
But
as
the
dementors
seem
to
have
developed
a
particular
interest
in
you
perhaps
I
should
teach
you
But
after
the
holidays
For
now
I
need
to
rest
Flitch
Last
call
for
Hogsmeade
Come
on
now

the
secret
to
our
success
George
Its
a
wrench

it
to
you

decided
your
needs
are
greater
than
ours
Fred
George
if
you
will
George
I
solemnly
swear
that
I
am
up
to
no
good
Harry
Mrs
Moony

Hermione

McGonagall
Cornelius
Hagrid
Allow

minister
Fudge
Oh
Hagrid
Hagrid
Sorry
about
that
Fudge
Rosmerta
my
dear
I
hope
business
is
good
Rosmerta
Itd
be
a
lot
better
if
the
Ministry
wasnt
sending
dementors
into
my
pub
every
other
night
Fudge
We
have
We
have
a
killer
on
the
loose
Rosmerta
Sirius
Black
in
Hogsmeade
And
what
would
bring
him
here
Fudge
Harry
Potter
Rosmerta
Harry
Potter
Fudge
Come
Hermione
Harry
Shrunken

No

Hermione
So

Ron
Thick

Shrunken
Heads
Thick
heads
How

Who

they
calling
thick
heads
Young
whippersnappers
Rosmerta
Nobodys
going
to
come
to
a
pub
where
theyre
gonna
get
scared
out
of
their
wits
Why
McGonagall
Professor
Dumbledore
does
not
want
dementors
around
the
place
I
can
assure
you
Rosmerta
Now
tell
me
what
this
is
all
about
McGonagall
Well
Now
years
ago
when
Harry
Potters
parents
realized
they
were
marked
for
death
You
remember
They
went
into
hiding
Few
knew
where
they
were
One
who
did
was
Sirius
Black
And
he
told
You
Know
Who
Fudge
Not
only
did
Black
lead
You
Know
Who
to
the
Potters
that
night
but
he
also
killed
one
of
their
friends
Peter
Pettigrew
Rosmerta
Peter
Pettigrew
McGonagall
Yes
little
lump
of
a
boy
Always
trailing
after
Sirius
Black
Rosmerta
Ah
I
remember
him
Never
let
James
and
Sirius
out
of
his
sight
But
what
happened
McGonagall
Well
Peter
Pettigrew
tried
to
warn
the
Potters
and
might
have
managed
to
had
he
not
run
into
an
old
friend
Sirius
Black
Fudge
Black
was
vicious
He
didnt
kill
Pettigrew
He
destroyed
him
A
finger
Thats
all
that
was
left
A
finger
Nothing
else
McGonagall
Yes
Sirius
Black
may
not
have
put
his
hands
to
the
Potters
but
hes
the
reason
theyre
dead
Fudge
And
now
he
wants
to
finish
what
he
started
McGonagall
Mhmm
Rosmerta
I
dont
believe
it
Fudge
Ah
thats
not
the
worst
of
it
Rosmerta
What
could
be
worse
McGonagall
This
Sirius
Black
was
and
remains
to
this
day
Harry
Potters
godfather
Hermione
Ron
look
Sorry
sorry
Excuse
me
excuse
me
sorry
Harry
what
happened
Harry
He
was
their
friend
and
he
betrayed
them
He
was
their
friend
I
hope
he
finds
me
Because
when
he
does
Im
gonna
be
ready
When
he
does
Im
gonna
kill
him
Lupin
Harry
There
you
are
You
came
Are
you
sure
about
this
Harry
You
know
this
is
very
advanced
magic
well
beyond
the
Ordinary
Wizarding
Level
Harry
Im
sure
Lupin
Well
everythings
prepared
Now
the
spell
Im
going
to
try
to
teach
you
is
called
the
Patronus
Charm
Did
you
ever
hear
of
it
No
Well
A
Patronus
is
a
kind
of
positive
force
For
the
wizard
who
conjures
one
it
works
something
like
a
shield
with
the
dementor
feeding
on
it
rather
than
him
But
in
order
for
it
to
work
you
need
to
think
of
a
memory
Not
just
any
memory
a
very
happy
memory
a
very
powerful
memory
Lupin
Can
you
do
this
Yes
Very
well
Close
your
eyes
Concentrate
Explore
your
past
Do
you
have
a
memory
Allow
it
to
fill
you
up
Lose
yourself
within
it
Then
speak
the
incantation
Expecto
Patronum
Harry
Expecto
Patronum
Lupin
Very
good
Shall
we
Wand
at
the
ready
Harry
Expecto
Patronum
Expecto
Expecto
Expect
Lupin
Here
we
go
Come
on
Sit
up
Deep
breaths
Its
all
right
I
didnt
expect
you
to
do
it
the
first
time
That
would
have
been
remarkable
Here
eat
this
Youll
feel
better
Harry
Thats
one
nasty
dementor
Lupin
Oh
no
no
no
That
was
a
boggart
Harry
A
boggart
The
real
thing
would
be
worse
Much
much
worse
As
a
matter
of
interest
what
were
you
thinking
Which
memory
did
you
choose
Harry
The
first
time
I
rode
a
broom
Lupin
Thats
not
good
enough
Not
nearly
good
enough
Harry
Theres
another
Its
not
happy
exactly
Well
it
is
Its
the
happiest
Ive
ever
felt
but
its
complicated
Lupin
Is
it
strong
Then
lets
give
it
a
try
You
feel
ready
Harry
Just
do
it
Expecto
Patronum
Expecto
Patronum
Lupin
Yes
Well
done
Harry
Well
done
Harry
I
think
Ive
had
enough
for
today
Lupin
Yes
Sit
down
Here
Eat
this
it
helps
It
really
helps
And
just
so
you
know
Harry
I
think
youd
have
given
your
father
a
run
for
his
money
And
that
is
saying
something
Harry
I
was
thinking
of
him
And
Mom
Seeing
their
faces
They
were
talking
to
me
Just
talking
Thats
the
memory
I
chose
I
dont
even
know
if
its
real
But
its
the
best
I
have
Hermione
Beautiful
day
Ron
Gorgeous
Ron
Unless
of
course
youve
been
ripped
to
pieces
Harry
Ripped
to
pieces
What
are
you
talking
about
Hermione
Ronald
has
lost
his
rat
Ron
I
havent
lost
anything
Your
cat
killed
him
Hermione
Rubbish
Ron
Harry
youve
seen
the
way
that
bloodthirsty
beast
of
hers
is
always
lurking
about
And
Scabbers
is
gone
Hermione
Well
maybe
you
should
take
better
care
of
your
pets
Ron
Your
cat
killed
him
Hermione
Did
not
Ron
Did
Hermione
Didnt
Hermione
How
did
it
go
Hagrid
The
hearing
Hagrid
Well
first
off
the
committee
members
took
turns
talking
about
why
we
were
there
And
then
I
got
up
and
did
my
piece
Said
how
Buckbeak
was
a
good
hippogriff
always
cleaned
his
feathers
And
then
Lucius
Malfoy
got
up
Well
you
can
imagine
He
said
Buckbeak
was
a
deadly
and
dangerous
creature
who
would
kill
you
as
soon
as
look
at
you
Hermione
And
then
Hagrid
And
then
he
asked
for
the
worst
did
old
Lucius
Harry
Theyre
not
sacking
you
Hagrid
No
Im
not
sacked
Buckbeaks
been
sentenced
to
death
Ron
Spiders

Theres
spiders
Spiders
They
want
me
to

Rosmerta

Pettigrew
McGonagall

Always
trailing
after
Sirius

Fudge
Black

He
didnt
kill
Pettigrew

destroyed
him

Snape

wandering
the
corridors
at
night
Harry
I
was
sleepwalking
Snape
How
extraordinarily
like
your
father
you
are
Potter
He
too
was
exceedingly
arrogant
strutting
about
the
castle
Harry
My
dad
didnt
strut
And
nor
do
I
Now
if
you
dont
mind
I
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
lower
your
wand
Snape
Turn
out
your
pockets
Turn

pockets

Harry
Spare
bit

Snape
Really
Open
it
Reveal
your
secrets
Read
it
Harry
Mrs
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
offer
their
compliments
to
Professor
Snape
and

Snape
Go
on
Harry
And
request
that
he
keep
his
abnormally
large
nose
out
of
other
peoples
business
Snape
Why
you
insolent
little
Lupin
Professor
Snape
Well
well
Lupin
Out
for
a
little
walk
in
the
moonlight
are
we
Lupin
Harry
are
you
alright
Snape
That
remains
to
be
seen
I
have
just
now
confiscated
a
rather
curious
artifact
from
Mr
Potter
Take
a
look
Lupin
Supposed
to
be
your
area
of
expertise
Clearly
its
full
of
dark
magic
Lupin
Oh
I
seriously
doubt
it
Severus
It
looks
as
though
its
merely
a
parchment
designed
to
insult
anyone
who
tries
to
read
it
I
suspect
its
a
Zonko
product
Nevertheless
I
shall
investigate
any
hidden
qualities
it
may
possess
It
is
after
all
as
you
say
my
area
of
expertise
Harry
would
you
come
with
me
please
Professor
good
night
Ghost

Are
you
deaf
Put
that
light
out
Lupin
Come
in
I
havent
the
faintest
idea
how
this
map
came
to
be
in
your
possession
but
quite
frankly
I
am
astounded
that
you
didnt
hand
it
in
Did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
this
in
the
hands
of
Sirius
Black
is
a
map
to
you
Harry
No
No
sir
Lupin
Your
father
never
set
much
store
by
the
rules
either
But
he
and
your
mother
gave
their
lives
to
save
yours
Gambling
their
sacrifice
by
wandering
around
the
castle
unprotected
with
a
killer
on
the
loose
seems
to
me
a
poor
way
to
repay
them
Now
I
will
not
cover
up
for
you
again
Harry
Do
you
hear
me
Harry
Yes
sir
Lupin
I
want
you
to
return
to
your
dormitory
and
stay
there
And
dont
take
any
detours
If
you
do
I
shall
know
Harry
Professor
just
so
you
know
I
dont
think
that
map
always
works
Earlier
it
showed
someone
in
the
castle
Someone
I
know
to
be
dead
Lupin
Oh
really
And
who
might
that
be
Harry
Peter
Pettigrew
Lupin
Thats
not
possible
Harry
Its
just
what
I
saw
Good
night
professor
Trelawney
Broaden
your
minds
You
must
look
beyond
The
art
of
crystal
gazing
is
in
the
clearing
of
the
Inner
Eye
Only
then
can
you
see
Try
again
Now
what
do
we
have
here
Hermione
Oh
do
you
mind
me
trying
The
Grim
possibly
Trelawney
My
dear
from
the
first
moment
you
stepped
foot
in
my
class
I
sensed
that
you
did
not
possess
the
proper
spirit
for
the
noble
art
of
Divination
No
you
see
there
You
may
be
young
in
years
but
the
heart
that
beats
beneath
your
bosom
is
as
shriveled
as
an
old
maids
your
soul
as
dry
as
the
pages
of
the
books
to
which
you
so
desperately
cleave
Have
I
said
something
Ron
Shes
gone
mental
Hermione
has
I
mean
not
that
she
wasnt
always
mental
but
now
its
in
the
open
for
everyone
to
see
Harry
Hang
on
We
better
take
this
back
Ron
Im
not
going
back
Harry
Fine
See
you
later
Ron
See
you
Siris
Harry
Potter
Harry
Professor
Trelawney
Trelawney
He
will
return
tonight
Harry
Sorry
Trelawney
Tonight
he
who
betrayed
his
friends
whose
heart
rots
with
murder
shall
break
free
Innocent
blood
shall
be
spilt
and
servant
and
master
shall
be
reunited
once
more
Im
so
sorry
dear
boy
Did
you
say
something
Harry
No
Nothing
Hermione
I
cant
believe
theyre
going
to
kill
Buckbeak
Its
just
too
horrible
Ron
It
just
got
worse
Malfoy
Now
Ill
tell
you
Father
said
I
can
keep
the
hippogriffs
head
I
think
Ill
donate
it
to
the
Gryffindors
room
This
is
going
to
be
rich
Look
whos
here
Come
to
see
the
show
Hermione
You
You
foul
loathsome
evil
little
cockroach
Ron
Hermione
no
Hes
not
worth
it
Crabbe
Malfoy
are
you
okay
Lets
go
Quick
Malfoy
Not
a
word
to
anyone
understood
Hermione
That
felt
good
Ron
Not
good
brilliant
Hagrid
Look
at
him
Loves
the
smell
of
the
trees
when
the
wind
blows
through
them
Harry
Why
dont
we
just
set
him
free
Hagrid
Theyd
know
it
was
me
and
then
Dumbledore
would
get
into
trouble
Hes
coming
down
you
know
Dumbledore
Says
he
wants
to
be
with
me
when
they
When
it
happens
Great
man
Dumbledore
A
great
man
Hermione
Well
stay
with
you
too
Hagrid
Hagrid
Youll
do
no
such
thing
Think
I
want
you
seeing
something
like
that
No
You
just
drink
your
tea
and
be
off
Oh
Before
you
do
Ron
Ron
Scabbers
Youre
alive
Hagrid
Keep
a
closer
eye
on
your
pets
Ron
Hermione
I
think
that
means
you
owe
someone
an
apology
Ron
Right
Next
time
I
see
Crookshanks
Ill
let
him
know
Hermione
I
meant
me
Hagrid
Blimey
What
was
that
Harry
Ow

Hagrid

Dumbledore

Fudge
No
Hagrid

you
Now
gentlemen
Dumbledore
Id
like
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
Fudge
Well
I
think
we
should
get
down
to
our
business
shall
we
Very
well
It
is
the
decision
of
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
that
the
hippogriff
known
as
Buckbeak
hereinafter
called
the
condemned
shall
be
executed
this
day
at
sundown
Hagrid
Dear
dear
Dumbledore
Now

Hagrid
Now
come
on
All
right
Itll
be
all
right
Fudge
The
execution
shall
dispatch
Harry
What
Hermione
I
thought
I
just

Never

Ron
Lets

Hagrid
Buckbeak

mean

harm
Ron
Oh

Ron
He

Wait

Scabbers

Hermione
Harry

what
tree

is
Harry
Thats
not

Ron

Ron
Harry
Hermione

Its
the
Grim
Harry
Hermione
Ron
Ron

Harry
Ron
Help
Harry
Ron
Ron
Ron
Ron
Come
on
Move
Hermione
Duck
Hermione
Harry
Hermione
Oh
Im
sorry
Harry
Dont
worry
Hermione
Where
do
you
suppose
this
goes
Harry
I
have
a
hunch
I
just
hope
Im
wrong
Hermione
Were
in
the
Shrieking
Shack
arent
we
Harry
Come
on
Ron
Hermione
Ron
Youre
okay
The
dog
Where
is
it
Ron
Harry
its
a
trap
Hes
the
dog
Hes
an
Animagus
Hermione
If
you
want
to
kill
Harry
youll
have
to
kill
us
too
Siris
No
Only
one
will
die
tonight
Harry
Then
itll
be
you
Siris
Are
you
going
to
kill
me
Harry
Lupin
Expelliarmus
Well
well
Sirius
Looking
rather
ragged
arent
we
Finally
the
flesh
reflects
the
madness
within
Siris
Well
youd
know
all
about
the
madness
within
wouldnt
you
Remus
I
found
him
Lupin
I
know
Siris
Its
him
Lupin
I
understand
Siris
Lets
kill
him
Hermione
No
I
trusted
you
And
all
this
time
youve
been
his
friend
Hes
a
werewolf
Thats
why
hes
been
missing
classes
Lupin
How
long
have
you
known
Hermione
Since
Professor
Snape
set
the
essay
Lupin
Well
well
well
Hermione
You
really
are
the
brightest
witch
of
your
age
Ive
ever
met
Siris
Enough
talk
Remus
Come
on
lets
kill
him
Lupin
Wait
Siris
I
did
my
waiting
Twelve
years
of
it
In
Azkaban
Lupin
Very
well
Kill
him
But
wait
one
more
minute
Harry
has
the
right
to
know
why
Harry
I
know
why
You
betrayed
my
parents
Youre
the
reason
theyre
dead
Lupin
No
Harry
it
wasnt
him
Somebody
did
betray
your
parents
but
it
was
somebody
who
until
quite
recently
I
believed
to
be
dead
Harry
Who
was
it
then
Siris
Peter
Pettigrew
And
hes
in
this
room
Right
now
Come
out
come
out
Peter
Come
out
come
out
and
play
Snape
Expelliarmus
Vengeance
is
sweet
How
I
hoped
Id
be
the
one
to
catch
you
Siris
Severus
Snape
I
told
Dumbledore
you
were
helping
an
old
friend
into
the
castle
and
now
heres
the
proof
Siris
Brilliant
Snape
Once
again
youve
put
your
keen
penetrating
mind
to
the
task
and
as
usual
come
to
the
wrong
conclusion
Now
if
youll
excuse
us
Remus
and
I
have
some
unfinished
business
to
attend
to
Snape
Give
me
a
reason
I
beg
you
Lupin
Severus
dont
be
a
fool
Siris
He
cant
help
it
Its
habit
Lupin
Sirius
be
quiet
Siris
Be
quiet
yourself
Remus
Snape
Oh
listen
to
you
two
quarreling
like
an
old
married
couple
Siris
Why
dont
you
run
along
and
play
with
your
chemistry
set
Snape
I
could
do
it
you
know
But
why
deny
the
dementors
Theyre
so
longing
to
see
you
Do
I
detect
a
flicker
of
fear
Oh
yes
A
Dementors
Kiss
One
can
only
imagine
what
that
must
be
like
Its
said
to
be
nearly
unbearable
to
witness
but
Ill
do
my
best
Lupin
Severus
please
Snape
After
you
Harry
Expelliarmus
Ron
Harry
What
did
you
just
do
Hermione
You
attacked
a
teacher
Harry
Tell
me
about
Peter
Lupin
He
was
at
school
with
us
We
thought
he
was
our
friend
Harry
No
Pettigrews
dead
You
killed
him
Lupin
No
he
didnt
I
thought
so
too
until
you
mentioned
seeing
Pettigrew
on
the
map
Harry
The
map
was
lying
then
Siris
The
map
never
lies
Pettigrews
alive
And
hes
right
there
Ron
Me
Hes
mental
Siris
Not
you
Your
rat
Ron
Scabbers
has
been
in
my
family
for
Siris
Twelve
years
Curiously
long
life
for
a
common
garden
rat
Hes
missing
a
toe
isnt
he
Ron
So
what
Harry
All
they
could
find
of
Pettigrew
was
his
Siris
Finger
That
dirty
coward
cut
it
off
so
everyone
would
think
he
was
dead
And
then
he
transformed
into
a
rat
Harry
Show
me
Give
it
to
him
Ron
Ron
What
are
you
trying
to
do
to
him
Scabbers
Leave
him
alone
Get
off
him
What
are
you
doing
Pettigrew
Remus
Sirius
My
old
friends
Harry
Look
at
you
You
look
so
much
like
your
father
Like
James
We
were
the
best
of
friends
Siris
How
dare
you
speak
to
Harry
How
dare
you
talk
about
James
in
front
of
him
Lupin
You
sold
James
and
Lily
to
Voldemort
didnt
you
Pettigrew
I
didnt
mean
to
The
Dark
Lord
You
have
no
idea
the
weapons
he
possesses
Ask
yourself
Sirius
What
would
you
have
done
What
would
you
have
done
Siris
I
would
have
died
I
would
have
died
rather
than
betray
my
friends
Pettigrew
Harry
James
wouldnt
have
wanted
me
killed
Your
dad
Your
dad
would
have
spared
me
He
would
show
me
mercy
Lupin
You
shouldve
realized
Peter
that
if
Voldemort
didnt
kill
you
then
we
would
Together
Harry
No
Lupin
Harry
this
man
Harry
I
know
what
he
is
But
well
take
him
to
the
castle
Pettigrew
Bless
you
boy
Bless
you
Harry
Get
off
I
said
wed
take
you
to
the
castle
After
that
the
dementors
can
have
you
Siris
Sorry
about
the
bite
I
reckon
that
twinges
a
bit
Ron
A
bit
A
bit
You
almost
tore
my
leg
off
Siris
I
was
going
for
the
rat
Normally
I
have
a
very
sweet
disposition
as
a
dog
In
fact
more
than
once
James
suggested
that
I
make
the
change
permanent
The
tail
I
could
live
with
But
the
fleas
theyre
murder
Harry
Okay
Ron
You
better
go
Harry
No
Dont
worry
okay
Its
fine
Ill
stay
Hermione
You
go
Ill
stay
Harry
You
okay
Ron
Im
fine
Go
Hermione
That
looks
really
painful
Ron
So
painful
They
might
chop
it
Hermione
Im
sure
Madam
Pomfrey
will
fix
it
in
a
heartbeat
Ron
Its
too
late
Its
ruined
Itll
have
to
be
chopped
off
Siris
Its
beautiful
isnt
it
Ill
never
forget
the
first
time
I
walked
through
those
doors
Itll
be
nice
to
do
it
again
as
a
free
man
That
was
a
noble
thing
you
did
back
there
He
doesnt
deserve
it
Harry
Well
I
just
didnt
think
my
dad
would
have
wanted
his
two
best
friends
to
become
killers
Besides
dead
the
truth
dies
with
him
Alive
youre
free
Pettigrew
Turn
me
into
a
maggot
Turn
me
into
a
flobberworm
Anything
but
the
dementors
Ron
Havent
I
been
a
good
friend
A
good
pet
You
wont
let
them
give
me
to
the
dementors
will
you
I
was
your
rat
Sweet
girl
Clever
girl
Surely
you
wont
let
them
Lupin
Get
away
from
her
Siris
I
dont
know
if
you
know
Harry
but
when
you
were
born
James
and
Lily
made
me
your
godfather
Harry
I
know
Siris
I
can
understand
if
you
choose
to
stay
with
your
aunt
and
uncle
but
if
you
ever
wanted
a
different
home
Harry
What
Come
and
live
with
you
Siris
Its
just
a
thought
I
can
understand
if
you
dont
want
to
Hermione
Harry
Siris
Remus
my
old
friend
Have
you
taken
your
potion
tonight
You
know
the
man
you
truly
are
Remus
This
heart
is
where
you
truly
live
This
heart
here
This
flesh
is
only
flesh
Harry
Expelliarmus
Hermione
Harry
Siris
Remus
Remus
Run
Run
Harry
Come
on
Hermione
Wait
Wait
Ron
Hermione
Bad
idea
Bad
idea
Hermione
Professor
Professor
Lupin
Ron
Nice
doggy
Nice
doggy
Snape
There
you
are
Potter
Harry
Sirius
Snape
Come
back
here
Potter
Harry
Sirius
No
Sirius
Expecto
Patronum
Hermione
Harry
Harry
I
saw
my
dad
Hermione
What
Harry
He
sent
the
dementors
away
I
saw
him
across
the
lake
Hermione
Listen
Harry
theyve
captured
Sirius
Any
minute
the
dementors
are
going
to
perform
the
Kiss
Harry
You
mean
theyre
gonna
kill
him
Hermione
No
Its
worse
Much
worse
Theyre
going
to
suck
out
his
soul
Headmaster
youve
got
to
stop
them
Theyve
got
the
wrong
man
Harry
Its
true
Sirius
is
innocent
Ron
Its
Scabbers
who
did
it
Dumbledore
Scabbers
Ron
Hes
my
rat
sir
Hes
not
really
a
rat
He
was
a
rat
He
was
my
brother
Percys
rat
But
then
they
gave
him
an
owl
Hermione
The
point
is
we
know
the
truth
Please
believe
us
Dumbledore
I
do
Miss
Granger
But
the
word
of
three

year
old
wizards
will
convince
few
others
A
childs
voice
however
honest
and
true
is
meaningless
to
those
who
have
forgotten
how
to
listen
Mysterious
thing
time
Powerful
and
when
meddled
with
dangerous
Sirius
Black
is
in
the
topmost
cell
of
the
Dark
Tower
You
know
the
laws
Miss
Granger
You
must
not
be
seen
And
you
would
do
well
I
feel
to
return
before
this
last
chime
If
not
the
consequences
are
too
ghastly
to
discuss
If
you
succeed
tonight
more
than
one
innocent
life
may
be
spared
Three
turns
should
do
it
I
think
Oh
and
by
the
way
When
in
doubt
I
find
retracing
my
steps
to
be
a
wise
place
to
begin
Good
luck
Ron
What
the
bloody
hell
was
that
all
about
Hermione
Sorry
Ron
but
seeing
as
you
cant
walk
Harry
What
just
happened
Wheres
Ron
Hermione

Where
were
we
at

Harry
I
dont
know
Going
to
Hagrids
Hermione
Come
on
And
we
cant
be
seen
Harry
Hermione
Hermione
Hermione
wait
Hermione
will
you
please
tell
me
what
it
is
were
doing
Hermione
You
foul
loathsome
evil
little
cockroach
Harry
Thats
us
Ron
Hermione
no
Hes
not
worth
it
Harry
This
is
not
normal
Hermione
This
is
a
Time
Turner
Harry
McGonagall
gave
it
to
me
first
term
This
is
how
Ive
been
getting
to
my
lessons
all
year
Harry
You
mean
weve
gone
back
in
time
Hermione
Yes
Dumbledore
obviously
wanted
us
to
return
to
this
moment
Clearly
something
happened

Fudge
Oh

Indeed

Dumbledore
And

Hagrid
Buckbeak
Fudge
Come

Dumbledore
Someones

him
Fudge
Hagrid
Hermione
Buckbeak
Dumbledore
I
dont
think
the
ministers
suggesting
you
had
anything
to
do
with
this
How
could
you
Youve
been
with
us
all
the
time
Fudge
Right
Well
well
We
must
search
the
grounds
Dumbledore
Well
search
the
skies
if
you
must
minister
Meanwhile
Id
like
a
nice
cup
of
tea
or
a
large
brandy
Oh
executioner
your
services
are
no
longer
required
Thank
you
Hagrid
Youll
find
no
small
glasses
in
this
house
professor
Harry
Come
on
This
way
This
way
now
Now
what
Hermione
We
save
Sirius
Harry
How
Hermione
No
idea
Look
Its
Lupin
Lupin
Immobulus
Hermione
And
Snapes
coming
Harry
And
now
we
wait
Hermione
And
now
we
wait
Hermione
At
least
someones
enjoying
himself
Harry
Yeah
Hermione
Hermione
Yeah
Harry
Before
down
by
the
lake
when
I
was
with
Sirius
I
did
see
someone
That
someone
made
the
dementors
go
away
Hermione
With
a
Patronus
I
heard
Snape
telling
Dumbledore
According
to
him
only
a
really
powerful
wizard
could
have
conjured
it
Harry
It
was
my
dad
My
dad
conjured
the
Patronus
Hermione
Harry
but
your
dads
Dead
I
know
Im
just
telling
you
what
I
saw
Hermione
Here
we
come
Harry
You
see
Sirius
talking
to
me
there
Hes
asking
me
to
come
live
with
him
Hermione
Thats
great
Harry
When
we
free
him
Ill
never
have
to
go
back
to
the
Dursleys
Itll
just
be
me
and
him
We
could
live
in
the
country
someplace
you
can
see
the
sky
I
think
hell
like
that
after
all
those
years
in
Azkaban
Hermione
Harry
Run
Harry
Lets
go
What
are
you
doing
Hermione
Saving
your
life
Harry
Thanks
Great
Now
hes
coming
for
us
Hermione
Yeah
I
didnt
think
about
that
Run
Hermione
That
was
so
scary
Harry
Poor
Professor
Lupins
having
a
really
tough
night
Sirius
Come
on
Hermione
This
is
horrible
Harry
Dont
worry
My
dad
will
come
Hell
conjure
the
Patronus
Any
minute
now
Right
there
Youll
see
Hermione
Harry
listen
to
me
No
ones
coming
Harry
Dont
worry
he
will
He
will
come
Sirius
Hermione
Youre
dying
both
of
you
Harry
Harry
Expecto
Patronum
Harry
You
were
right
Hermione
It
wasnt
my
dad
I
saw
earlier
It
was
me
I
saw
myself
conjuring
the
Patronus
before
I
knew
I
could
do
it
this
time
because
well
I
had
already
done
it
Does
that
make
sense
Hermione
No
Hermione
But
I
dont
like
flying

Hermione
Bombarda
Siris
Ill
be
forever
grateful
for
this
to
both
of
you
Harry
I
want
to
go
with
you
Siris
One
day
perhaps
For
some
time
my
life
will
be
too
unpredictable
And
besides
youre
meant
to
be
here
Harry
But
youre
innocent
Siris
And
you
know
it
And
for
now
that
will
do
I
expect
youre
tired
of
hearing
this
but
you
look
so
like
your
father
Except
your
eyes
You
have
Harry
My
mothers
eyes
Siris
Its
cruel
that
I
spent
so
much
time
with
James
and
Lily
and
you
so
little
But
know
this
The
ones
that
love
us
never
really
leave
us
And
you
can
always
find
them
in
here
You
really
are
the
brightest
witch
of
your
age
Hermione
We
have
to
go
Dumbledore
Well
Harry
Hes
free
We
did
it
Dumbledore
Did
what
Good
night
Ron
How
did
you
get
there
I
was
talking
to
you
there
And
now
youre
there
Hermione
Whats
he
talking
about
Harry
Harry
I
dont
know
Honestly
Ron
How
can
somebody
be
in
two
places
at
once
Lupin
Hello
Harry
I
saw
you
coming
Ive
looked
worse
believe
me
Harry
Youve
been
sacked
Lupin
No
No
I
resigned
actually
Harry
Resigned
Why
Lupin
Well
it
seems
that
somebody
let
slip
the
nature
of
my
condition
This
time
tomorrow
the
owls
will
start
arriving
and
parents
will
not
want
well
someone
like
me
teaching
their
children
Harry
But
Dumbledore
Lupin
Dumbledore
has
already
risked
enough
on
my
behalf
Besides
people
like
me
are
Well
lets
just
say
that
Im
used
to
it
by
now
Lupin
Why
do
you
look
so
miserable
Harry
Harry
None
of
it
made
any
difference
Pettigrew
escaped
Lupin
Didnt
make
any
difference
Harry
it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
You
have
uncovered
the
truth
You
saved
an
innocent
man
from
a
terrible
fate
It
made
a
great
deal
of
difference
If
I
am
proud
of
anything
it
is
of
how
much
you
have
learned
this
year
Now
since
I
am
no
longer
your
teacher
I
feel
no
guilt
whatsoever
about
giving
this
back
to
you
So
now
Ill
say
goodbye
Harry
I
feel
sure
well
meet
again
sometime
Until
then
mischief
managed
Ron
Stand
back
I
said
Or
Ill
take
it
upstairs
if
you
dont
settle
Neville
Harry
Wherever
did
you
get
it
Seamus
Can
I
have
a
go
Harry
After
you
of
course
Harry
What
are
you
talking
about
Ron
Quiet
Let
the
man
through
I
didnt
mean
to
open
it
Harry
It
was
badly
wrapped
They
made
me
do
it
FredGeorge
Did
not
Others
Its
a
Firebolt
Its
the
fastest
broom
in
the
world
Harry
For
me
But
who
sent
it
Ron
No
one
knows
Hermione
This
came
with
it
Neville
Go
on
Harry
Seamus
Yeah
lets
see
Hermione
How
fast
is
it
Harry
Harry
Lumos
